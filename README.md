### Business Problem

Vanguard aims to enhance the user experience with a more intuitive interface and in-context prompts. The challenge is to determine if these changes will increase the completion rate of client processes.

### Objective

The objective of this analysis is to assess the effectiveness of a new user interface in improving customer process completion rates using A/B testing techniques.

### Key Metrics

- **Completion rate**
- **Time Spend each step**
- **Total time spend**
- **Error rate** 

### Methodology

The data were divided into control (0) and test (1) groups. 
We subsequently eliminated the % that had not been included in these two groups. So all the ratios focus on the total number of users in groups 0 and 1.

## Tools & technology

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib, scipy.stats, Seaborn   
- **Visualization**: Tableau
- **Data Storage**: CSV, xlsx.
